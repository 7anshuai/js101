  <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name">Scope</h1>
  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>&quot;Scope&quot; refers to the variables that are available to a piece of code at a given time. A lack of understanding of scope can lead to frustrating debugging experiences. The idea of scope is that it&#39;s where certain functions or variables are accessible from in our code, and the context in which they exist and are executed in.</p>
<p>There are two types of scopes in JavaScript: global and local. Let&#39;s talk about each of them in turn.</p>
<h2 id="global-scope">Global Scope</h2><p>The first scope is <strong>Global Scope</strong>. This is very easy to define. If a variable or function is <em>global</em>, it can be accessed from anywhere within a program. In a browser, the global scope is the <code>window</code> object. If a variable declaration occurs outside of a function, then that variable exists on the global object. For example:</p>
<pre>var x = 9;</pre><p>Once that variable had been defined, it could be referenced as <code>window.x</code>, but because it exists on the global object we can simply refer to it as <code>x</code>.</p>
<h2 id="local-scope">Local Scope</h2><p>JavaScript also creates a <strong>Local Scope</strong> inside each function body. For example:</p>
<pre>function myFunc() {
    var x = 5;
}

myFunc();

console.log( x ); // ReferenceError: x is not defined</pre><p>Since <code>x</code> was initialized within <code>.myFunc()</code>, it is only accessible within <code>.myFunc()</code>, and we get a reference error if we try to access it outside of <code>.myFunc()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-of-caution">A Word of Caution</h2><p>If you declare a variable and forget to use the <code>var</code> keyword, that variable is automatically made global. So this code would work:</p>
<pre>function myFunc() {
    x = 5;
}

myFunc();

console.log( x ); // 5</pre><p>This is a bad idea. Any variable that is global can have its value changed by any other parts of a program or any other script. This is undesirable, as it could lead to unforeseen side effects.</p>
<p>Secondly, Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions provide a way to avoid global variables. You&#39;ll see many libraries such as  jQuery often use these:</p>
<pre>(function() {
    var jQuery = { /* All my methods go here. */ };
    window.jQuery = jQuery;
})();</pre><p>Wrapping everything in a function which is then immediately invoked means all the variables within that function are bound to the <em>local scope</em>. At the very end you can then expose all your methods by binding the <code>jQuery</code> object to the <code>window</code>, the <em>global object</em>. To read more about Immediately-Invoked Functions, check out Ben Alman&#39;s <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/">Immediately-Invoked Function Expression</a> article.</p>
<p>Because local scope works through functions, any functions defined within another have access to variables defined in the outer function:</p>
<pre>function outer() {
    var x = 5;

    function inner() {
        console.log( x );
    }

    inner(); // 5
}</pre><p>But the <code>.outer()</code> function doesn&#39;t have access to any variables declared within <code>.inner()</code>:</p>
<pre>function outer() {
    var x = 5;

    function inner() {
        console.log( x );
        var y = 10;
    }

    inner(); // 5

    console.log( y ); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}</pre><p>Furthermore, variables that are declared inside a function without the <code>var</code> keyword are not local to the function â€“ JavaScript will traverse the scope chain all the way up to the window scope to find where the variable was previously defined. If the variable wasn&#39;t previously defined, it will be defined in the global scope, which can have unexpected consequences.</p>
<pre>// Functions have access to variables defined in the same scope.

var foo = &quot;hello&quot;;

var sayHello = function() {
    console.log( foo );
};

sayHello(); // &quot;hello&quot;

console.log( foo ); // &quot;hello&quot;</pre><p>Variables with the same name can exist in different scopes with different values:</p>
<pre>var foo = &quot;world&quot;;

var sayHello = function() {
    var foo = &quot;hello&quot;;
    console.log( foo );
};

sayHello(); // &quot;hello&quot;

console.log( foo ); // &quot;world&quot;</pre><p>When, within a function, you reference a variable defined in an outer scope, that function can see changes to the variable&#39;s value after the function is defined.</p>
<pre>var myFunction = function() {
    var foo = &quot;hello&quot;;
    var myFn = function() {
        console.log( foo );
    };
    foo = &quot;world&quot;;
    return myFn;
};

var f = myFunction();

f(); // &quot;world&quot;</pre><p>Here&#39;s a more complex example of scopes at play:</p>
<pre>(function() {

    var baz = 1;

    var bim = function() {
        console.log( baz );
    };

    bar = function() {
        console.log( baz );
    };

})();</pre><p>In this instance, running:</p>
<pre>console.log( baz ); // baz is not defined outside of the function</pre><p>Gives us a <code>ReferenceError</code>. <code>baz</code> was only defined within the function, and was never exposed to the global scope.</p>
<pre>bar(); //  1</pre><p><code>.bar()</code> may have been defined within the anonymous function, but it was defined without the <code>var</code> keyword, which means it wasn&#39;t bound to the local scope and was instead created globally. Furthermore, it has access to the <code>baz</code> variable because <code>.bar()</code> was defined within the same scope as <code>baz</code>. This means it has access to it, even though other code outside of the function does not.</p>
<pre>bim(); // ReferenceError: bim is not defined</pre><p><code>.bim()</code> was only defined within the function, so does not exist on the global object as it was defined locally.</p>

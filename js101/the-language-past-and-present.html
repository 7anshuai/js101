  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We&#39;ve covered a lot of ground since the first JS101, but the truth is I&#39;ve missed out an important question: what is JavaScript, and who controls it?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve answered this question and covered a lot more in the History of JavaScript series. This post is a brief introduction, and after reading this post you should know the basics of JavaScript and its relationship to ECMAScript.</p>
<h2 id="who-made-javascript">Who Made JavaScript?</h2><p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape. Netscape submitted JavaScript to <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">Ecma International</a>, which is a standards organization based in Geneva. The standardised version is known as ECMAScript.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ecmascript">What is ECMAScript?</h2><p>Most articles on sites like DailyJS will refer to ECMA-262, ECMAScript 3, and ECMAScript 5. We usually abbreviate these terms to ES3 and ES5.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMA-262</a> is the name of the specification, of which there are five editions</li>
<li>ECMAScript 3 (or ECMA-262, edition 3) was published in December 1999, and was supported by Netscape 6 and IE 5.5</li>
<li>ECMAScript 5 (or ECMA-262, edition 5) was published in December 2009 and is supported by Firefox 4+, Safari 6: <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/">ES5 compatibility table</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ECMAScript 5 adds a lot of features that we&#39;ve already started to take for granted: including new array methods like <code>forEach</code>, new <code>Object</code> methods like <code>Object.create</code>, property attributes, function binding, and more.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2><p>ECMAScript is still being actively developed. It&#39;s tentatively known as ES.next (ECMA-262 Edition 6), and ES.next working drafts can be downloaded from the <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Proposals for the language are collected on the strawman wiki, and discussed in detail by several contributors on the wiki and mailing lists. To keep up with this, I often check the wiki&#39;s recent changes and the es-discuss mailing list.</p>
<p><a href="https://brendaneich.com/">Brendan Eich&#39;s blog</a> covers a lot of the major developments as well. For example, his <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2012/06/recent-talks-fluent-txjs-2012/">latest post</a> mentions ES6 and the relationship between the standards makers and the enthusiastic JavaScript developer community.</p>
<p>The language will change, and as new standards are made available you&#39;ll need to know what your given platform or browser supports.</p>
